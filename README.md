Adler Books: Humanity Architecture on the Grid"Machines Reckon, Humans Judge."1. Project IdentityAdler Books is a publishing house dedicated to designing 'Humanity'—the essential quality we must preserve amidst the deluge of data in the AI era.We have deliberately stripped away flashy graphics and complex scripts. Instead, we embody the 'Code & Blood' philosophy: letting the warm, pulsating narrative of humans (Blood) flow through the most fundamental and mechanical languages (HTML/CSS).The Grid (Code): Cold terminals, monospaced fonts (Courier New), green signals. (The realm of AI)The Blood (Humanity): Elegant serif fonts (Noto Serif KR), red accents (#FF3333), authentic text. (The realm of Humans)2. Technical ArchitectureThis website aspires to 'Transcendental Simplicity.' To eliminate unnecessary computational resources and deliver messages instantly, anywhere, we strictly adhere to a No-Framework, No-JavaScript Dependency principle.2.1. Tech StackCore: Pure HTML5 / CSS3Hosting: GitHub Pages (Static Hosting)Font: Google Fonts (Noto Serif KR for Humanity / System Monospace for Code)2.2.
